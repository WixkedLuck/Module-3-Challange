# Module-Challange-3
## This is challenge three for UoM JavaScript: Password Generator
For this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating an application that a employee can use to generate random passwords, based off of a criteria set by the employee.

- The motivation behind this project was to become more familiar with JavaScript and learn how to create functions, use various methods of validation and learn how to create
a password generator based off an employees prefrences. 

- I built this project to further my understanding of JavaScript and practice what I have learned in class. Creating this password generator I was able to dive deeper into the different kind of loops I can use to complete a task and try out various .  

- This project resolves having a built in browser password generator that creates a unqiue password based of of how the user interacts with the prompts. By asking the user yes or no questions we can the create a password with elements such as upper case letter and numbers. Once the user has finished answering the questions a distinct password is generated.   

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable on JavaScript elements and completion of a online password generator while fulfilling a possible clients needs.
